#UnityPong

UnityPong is my first adventure into C# and Unity. It's a simple re-creation of the classic Pong arcade game. The ai is extremely simple, and will simply try to follow the ball at a set speed. The game is built following a youtube tutorial similar to [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nts3w1VQJaU&list=PLDj6B2jXbus1v9zD_IdPnGcim3uwSDELI), but I can no longer find it.

##Gameplay
Gameplay is simple, with no win condition. You can play forever. Note, there is an issue with the text placement, such that any double digit numbers will be displayed over the center line.

There is a '.exe' file that should allow anyone on a 64-bit Windows 10 machine to play the game.
